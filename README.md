- 👋 Hi, I’m @JDCowling
- 👀 I’m interested in Website and software development, gaming and hiking - with a passion for cave exploration too! :-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS, most times but always improving my existing skills relating to web and software development as there is so new things to learn everyday.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on.. anything, always to take a look at anything anyone has.
- 📫 You can reach me by emailing jd.cowling@outlook.com for anything questions you might have, from wanting a website or application developed to help with any projects, just send me a message and I will reply as soon as a I can.
